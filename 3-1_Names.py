# Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just           #
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes- #
# sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the   #
# person’s name.                                                              #

# create list names
names = ['jairo', 'morty', 'rick']

# # printing each item in a list
print(names[0].title())
print(names[1].title())
print(names[2].title())
